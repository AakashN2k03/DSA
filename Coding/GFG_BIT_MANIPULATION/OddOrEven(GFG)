GFG: Odd or Even 
class Solution {
  public:
    string oddEven(int n) {
       return (n & 1)==0 ? "even":"odd";
    }
};

// In binary representation, the least significant bit (LSB) determines whether a number is odd or even:

   //For an even number, the LSB is 0.
   //For an odd number, the LSB is 1.

// TO FIND ODD n & 1 == 1
// TO FIND EVEN n & 1 == 0

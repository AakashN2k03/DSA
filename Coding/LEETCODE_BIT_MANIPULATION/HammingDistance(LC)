LEETCODE: 461. Hamming Distance (XOR and AND and Right shift)

 // YOU can use same hamming code for 2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number and vice versa

class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int res = 0;
        int diff = x ^ y;  // XOR the two numbers to get positions where they differ
        while (diff != 0) {
            res += (diff & 1);  // Count the rightmost bit if it's 1
            diff >>= 1;  // Right shift to move to the next bit
        }
